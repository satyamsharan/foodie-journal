Accenture (and/or Accenture’s licensors as applicable) shall have sole and exclusive ownership and all rights, title and interest in and to the Licensed Materials and all derivative works, modifications and enhancements thereof (including ownership of all trade secrets, patents, copyrights and any other intellectual property rights pertaining thereto), subject only to the license rights expressly granted pursuant to this Agreement.

Licensee may not use, copy, modify, or distribute the Licensed Materials (electronically or otherwise), or any copy, adaptation, transcription, or merged portion thereof, except as expressly authorized by this Agreement.  Licensee may not (and shall not permit others to) reverse assemble, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Licensed Materials in any manner except to the extent that applicable law specifically prohibits such restrictions. Licensee’s rights herein may not be transferred, leased, encumbered, or assigned.  The License granted herein permits Licensee to use the Licensed Materials solely for its own benefit and its own internal business operations. No hosted work, multiple-user license, multi-party access arrangement, aggregation, or similar purpose for the benefit of a third party is authorized by the License granted herein.  To the extent Licensee creates any derivative works of the Software at any time, and to the extent Accenture does not retain all rights to such derivative works, Licensee hereby assigns all rights in such derivative works to Accenture.  In consideration of such assignment, Accenture shall grant Licensee a nontransferable, nonexclusive, limited license to use and copy such derivative works of the Software in accordance with the license terms and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable Schedule.

5.3 	Confidentiality.   Each party acknowledges that in the course of this business relationship it may have access to information which is proprietary, secret, private, and confidential ("Confidential Information") and which belongs to the other party.  Without limitation, the Licensed Materials and the terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information of Accenture.  Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other received as a result of this Agreement to any third party without the written consent of the other party provided, however, each party may permit access to Confidential Information to employees and agents of that party under confidentiality obligations consistent with this Agreement.   Confidential Information does not include any information which: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public through no disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (b) is wholly and independently developed by the receiving party without the use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; (c) becomes available to the receiving party from a source not a party to this Agreement, provided that such source is not violating any contractual or legal obligation; (d) was known on a lawful, non-confidential basis by the receiving party prior to disclosure; or (e) is required, based upon the reasonable advice of counsel, to be disclosed by any applicable law, regulation or competent judicial, governmental, or other authority.   If the receiving party becomes legally required to disclose any Confidential Information, the receiving party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with respect to that disclosure.  Each party will exercise commercially reasonable efforts not to disclose any personal data to the other party and to restrict the other party’s access to its personal data, but if a party is given access to the other party’s personal data, the receiving party will protect such personal data using a reasonable standard of care.

5.4 	Access by Contractors.  Licensee may disclose the Licensed Materials (excluding any source code) to third parties performing services for Licensee and with a need to know, provided that Licensee, prior to any disclosure, has executed a confidentiality agreement with such third party(s) that protects the confidentiality of Accenture’s Confidential Information consistent with Licensee’s obligations hereunder.  Any use or access by such third parties shall be solely for the purpose of conducting, or assisting Licensee with the conduct of, its internal business.  OR DESCRIBE LIMITED BUSINESS as needed].  Licensee shall be jointly and severally liable with any such third party contractors for any loss, misuse, or misappropriation of the Licensed Materials or Accenture's Confidential Information.  Any such loss, misuse, or misappropriation shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement by Licensee and shall be just cause for termination of this Agreement and any License(s) granted hereunder.

Accenture warrants that for a period of sixty (60) days from delivery (“Warranty Period”), the Software, as delivered to Licensee, will function in all material respects as described in the Specifications Section of the product documentation.  Licensee shall promptly (but in no event later than ten days after discovering the same) provide Accenture with written notice of any failure of the Software to perform as warranted.

6.3 	No Other Warranties.  EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, ACCENTURE MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS,  IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND/OR SERVICE QUALITY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND THOSE ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.  NO WARRANTY IS MADE THAT USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE’S FUNCTIONALITY WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS.
